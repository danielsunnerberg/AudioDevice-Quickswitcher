# AudioDevice Quickswitcher
Allows the user to quickly switch between selected audio devices through global hotkeys.
<br />This removes the need to physically disconnect the headset when wanting to play through speakers and so on.

Tested for Windows 7, 8 and 10.


## Installation
Install using the [ClickOnce-installer](https://github.com/danielsunnerberg/AudioDevice-Quickswitcher/releases/latest), or build the project from source yourself. Follow the setup wizard and you're set. 

## Credits
Controls audio devices by wrapping a [modified](https://github.com/danielsunnerberg/AudioEndPointController) version of [AudioEndPointController](https://github.com/DanStevens/AudioEndPointController).
